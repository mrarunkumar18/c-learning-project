# ðŸ“š C-Learning-Project: Building My Foundation in C ðŸš€

**A hands-on coding journal documenting my C programming journey as a 1st-year BCA student.**

This repository is where I actively convert **theory into code**. It serves as my practical lab for mastering the C programming language, the backbone of modern computer science, one module at a time.

## âœ¨ The Project Goal

The primary goal is to **master fundamental concepts** by writing clean, commented, and functional C code. This repository reflects my commitment to building a strong foundation in systems programming, from basic data structures to advanced memory concepts.

* **Focus Areas:** Clarity, effective commenting, practical problem-solving, and continuous progress tracking.
* **Perspective:** All code is written from the viewpoint of a student applying academic knowledge immediately.

## âœ… Current Progress Overview

This table summarizes the core concepts covered and my current active learning focus.

| Module | Chapter Folder(s) | Key Concepts Explored | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01. C Basics & I/O** | `chapter 0`, `chapter 1` | Program Structure, `printf`/`scanf`, Comments, Variables, Data Types (`int`, `float`, `char`). | **Completed** |
| **02. Data Manipulation** | `chapter 2`, `chapter 1 & 2 - practice set` | Arithmetic & Logical Operators, Operator Precedence, Type Casting, Expressions. | **Completed** |
| **03. Control Flow** | `chapter 3`, `chapter 3 - practice set` | **Conditional Statements** (`if-else`, `else-if`), Nested Logic, and `switch-case`. | **In Progress** |

### ðŸ’¡ Featured Examples

* **Practice Sets:** Dedicated folders containing my solutions to chapter-end problems, designed to reinforce learning.
* **Logic Programs:** Examples demonstrating early logical checks using operators and nested conditional statements.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Run the Code)

You need a C compiler (like **GCC**) installed on your system to run any of the source files in this repository.

### Prerequisites

* A C Compiler (**GCC** is highly recommended).
* A code editor (e.g., VS Code).

### Compilation and Execution Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mrarunkumar18/c-learning-project.git](https://github.com/mrarunkumar18/c-learning-project.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd c-learning-project
    ```

3.  **Compile a source file (Example from Chapter 3):**
    ```bash
    # Syntax: gcc [source_file.c] -o [output_name]
    gcc chapter_3/01_if_else.c -o conditional_check
    ```

4.  **Execute the compiled program:**
    ```bash
    ./conditional_check
    ```

## ðŸŽ¯ My Learning Roadmap

The immediate next steps in my BCA coursework and coding focus include:

1.  **Looping Constructs:** Mastering `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for efficient iteration.
2.  **Functions:** Writing modular, reusable code and mastering parameter passing.
3.  **Arrays and Strings:** Handling collections of data, including character arrays and basic string manipulation.
4.  **Pointers:** The next major milestoneâ€”deep diving into memory addresses, dynamic allocation, and advanced data structures.
