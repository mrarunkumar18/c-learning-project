# C-Learning-Project ðŸš€

This repository documents my hands-on journey learning the **C programming language** as a 1st-year BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) student. C is a foundational language for computer science, and this project serves as my practical lab to master its core concepts, from basic data types to advanced memory management.

## About This Repository

Each folder and file here corresponds to a module, lesson, or project I have completed. The goal is to apply theoretical knowledge immediately through coding to build a solid foundation in systems programming. I am actively managing this repository using Git and GitHub.

## Current Progress & Modules Covered âœ…

I am currently progressing through the fundamentals of C, focusing on the essential building blocks that enable logic and data handling.

| Module | Key Concepts Explored | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01. Variables & Data Types** | `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, Type Casting, Constants (`const`). | Completed |
| **02. Operators** | Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise, Increment/Decrement Operators. | Completed |
| **03. I/O & Program Structure** | **`printf`/`scanf`** (User Input/Output), **Comments** (for clean code), **`sizeof`** operator, and **Escape Sequences**. | Completed |

### Featured Projects

* **Grocery Store Project I & II:** Practical exercises simulating inventory management, pricing, and updating values using variables, constants, and operators.

## Getting Started (How to Run the Code)

You need a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system to run the code in this repository.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mrarunkumar18/c-learning-project.git](https://github.com/mrarunkumar18/c-learning-project.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd c-learning-project
    ```

3.  **Compile a Source File (Example):**
    Use the GCC compiler to compile any `.c` file.
    ```bash
    gcc your_file_name.c -o output_name
    ```

4.  **Execute the Program:**
    ```bash
    ./output_name
    ```

## My Roadmap (What's Next?) ðŸŽ¯

Following my learning roadmap, the next major topics I will be focusing on include:

* Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`).
* Looping Constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
* Arrays and Strings.
* **Functions and Pointers (The next major focus area!)**
