# ðŸ“š C-Learning-Project: Building My Foundation in C ðŸš€

**A hands-on coding journal documenting my C programming journey as a 1st-year BCA student.**

This repository is where I actively convert **theory into code**. It serves as my practical lab for mastering the C programming language, the backbone of modern computer science, one module at a time.

## âœ¨ The Project Goal

The primary goal is to **master fundamental concepts** by writing clean, commented, and functional C code. This repository reflects my commitment to building a strong foundation in systems programming, from basic data structures to advanced memory concepts.

* **Focus Areas:** Clarity, effective commenting, practical problem-solving, and continuous progress tracking.
* **Perspective:** All code is written from the viewpoint of a student applying academic knowledge immediately.
