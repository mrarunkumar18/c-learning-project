# 🚀 C-Learning-Project

A hands-on documentation of my journey learning the **C programming language** as a **1st-year BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications)** student.
C is the foundation of modern programming — the language that teaches you how computers *really think*. This repository is my personal coding lab where I’m turning theory into practice, one module at a time.

## 📘 About This Repository

Each folder and file in this repo represents a specific **lesson**, **module**, or **mini project** I’ve completed during my C learning journey.
The idea is simple: *learn by doing.* Every topic I study is followed by a coding experiment to make concepts stick.

## ✅ Current Progress

I’m currently exploring the **fundamentals** of C and building a strong base for systems programming and logic building.

| Module                 | Key Concepts Explored                                                                |    Status   |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------: |
| **01. Fundamentals**   | Variables (`int`, `float`, `char`), Data Types, Type Casting, Constants (`const`).   | ✅ Completed |
| **02. Operators**      | Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise, Increment/Decrement Operators.             | ✅ Completed |
| **03. Core Utilities** | `printf()` / `scanf()` I/O functions, Comments, `sizeof` operator, Escape Sequences. | ✅ Completed |

## ⚙️ How to Run the Code

You’ll need a **C compiler** (like GCC) installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrarunkumar18/c-learning-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd c-learning-project
   ```

3. **Compile any source file:**

   ```bash
   gcc your_file_name.c -o output_name
   ```

4. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   ./output_name
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Roadmap

I’m following a structured path to master C from basics to advanced topics:

* Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
* Looping Constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
* Arrays and Strings
* **Functions and Pointers — next major focus area!**
* File Handling and Memory Management (coming soon)
